"""The tenant-state gate on the MCP door (§3.4c).

This is the THIRD implementation of the rule — the two C++ doors share a header
verbatim, and that header does not reach Python. §3.4c names that exact risk:
"adding a check to N doors is N chances to add it subtly differently, and one
chance to forget a door entirely."

So `test_the_state_names_match_the_cpp_doors` PARSES the C++ header and compares.
If a state is added or renamed there and not here, this fails rather than this
door quietly admitting something the other two refuse.
