"""Primary/replica failover primitives (see design_documents/REPLICATION_FAILOVER.md).

A lazy circuit-breaker: a failed primary connection trips it for a cooldown, during
which requests fall back to the replica; after the cooldown the next request
re-probes the primary and resumes normal operation on success. No background threads.

The MCP server only touches LDAP (read-only auth), so there is no write/read-only
gating here — just directory failover."""
