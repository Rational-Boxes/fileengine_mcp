"""Which tenant states admit a login, for this door (§3.4c).

A MIRROR, NOT A COPY, and the difference is the point. The two C++ doors share
`tenant_state_policy.h` verbatim — §3.4c asks for "shared code rather than N
implementations wherever the doors' languages allow it", and between
http_bridge and webdav_bridge it does. It does not reach Python, so this is the
third implementation, which is exactly the situation §3.4c warns about:

    "Adding a check to N doors is N chances to add it subtly differently, and one
    chance to forget a door entirely."

So the state names and the admit rule are pinned against the C++ header by a
test that PARSES it (`tests/test_tenant_state.py`). If a state is added or a
name changed on that side and not here, the test fails rather than this door
quietly admitting something the others refuse.
